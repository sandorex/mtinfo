# mtinfo
`mtinfo` (Modern tinfo) is meant as a replacement for terminfo's awful binary format with something more modern, like JSON

The mtinfo will retain all the things terminfo has but there will also be additional features like:
- Custom capabilities, support capabilities not embraced by the standard like `truecolor` support for example
- Easily readable, it's easy to read JSON so why use a complex binary format, you don't even need a specific library to parse it!

<!-- TODO add 'base' so it can extend another mtinfo file -->
<!-- TODO standardised path to look for mtinfo files -->

### Example xterm-256color
```json
{
    "auto_left_margin": false,
    "auto_right_margin": true,
    "back_color_erase": true,
    ""

    "cap_enter_alternative_buffer": "\E[???"
}
```

The point of the standard is for it to be very simple and easily readable
