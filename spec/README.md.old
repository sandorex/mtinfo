# Specification mtinfo 20.6
`mtinfo` is meant as a replacement for `terminfo`, meant to be easy to read written in JSON

The path to look for `mtinfo` files is `$HOME/.mtinfo` (directory in the same place as the executable)

For windows (by order):
| Path                                  |
| ------------------------------------- |
| `mtinfo/` (folder of the executable)  |
| `.mtinfo/` (folder of the executable) |
| `MTINFO_DIRS` (env variable)          |
| `$HOME/.mtinfo/`                      |


Unix-like (by order):
| Path                                  |
| ------------------------------------- |
| `mtinfo/` (folder of the executable)  |
| `.mtinfo/` (folder of the executable) |
| `MTINFO_DIRS` (env variable)          |
| `/usr/share/mtinfo/`                  |
| `$HOME/.local/share/mtinfo/`          |

## Plan
The plan is to have `mtinfo` be primary source of terminal capability while converting it to terminfo for the legacy applications

## Example
```json
{
    "base": "",         // name of the base
    "names": [],        // list of names of the terminal
    "capabilities": {}, // capabilities and their values
    "aliases": {},      // aliases for capabilities
    "booleans": [],     // capabilities that are booleans
    "numbers": [],      // capabilities that are numbers
    "strings": [],      // capabilities that are strings
    "keys": {},         // keys and the code returned when they are pressed
}
```
<!-- TODO ability to check if capability (any type) is defined and also alternative version which acts same as terminfo and undefined boolean is false -->
